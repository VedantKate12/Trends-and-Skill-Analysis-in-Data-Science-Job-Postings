#  Job Postings & Trends Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive end-to-end **Data Analysis and Visualization** of job postings from various companies across the globe. The focus is on roles related to **Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning**. The analysis was conducted as a structured 9-day sprint, with each day targeting a specific analytical goal.

---

##  Dataset

The dataset (`cleaned_jobs.csv`) includes cleaned job postings and contains fields such as:

* Job Title
* Company Name
* Location (City, Country)
* Job Description
* Skill flags (e.g., Python, SQL, AWS, etc.)
